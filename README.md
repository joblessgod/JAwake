# Awake Plugin

**Awake** is a simple and fun plugin that adds chaotic events when a player enters a bed in Minecraft. Instead of peacefully sleeping, players are in for a surprise when unexpected entities and effects spawn around them.

## Features
- Spawns an **Arrow**, **Ender Crystal**, **Lightning**, and **Minecart TNT** at the player's location when they attempt to sleep.
- Drastically reduces the player's health to 1 to intensify the challenge.
  
## How It Works
When a player enters a bed, the following actions are triggered:
1. **Arrow**, **Ender Crystal**, **Lightning**, and **Minecart TNT** entities spawn at the player's current location.
2. The player's health is reduced to 1, making survival a bit more difficult!

## Installation
1. Download the plugin and place it in your server's `plugins` folder.
2. Restart your server, and enjoy the chaos when players try to sleep!

## Usage
Players simply need to enter a bed, and the effects will automatically trigger.
